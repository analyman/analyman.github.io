### Hessian Matrix

{% blockquote wikipedia, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix %}
In mathematics, the Hessian matrix or Hessian is a square matrix of 
second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, or scalar field. 
It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. 
The Hessian matrix was developed in the 19th century by the German mathematician 
Ludwig Otto Hesse and later named after him. Hesse originally used the term 
"functional determinants".
